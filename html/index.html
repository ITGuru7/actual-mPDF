			<p class="guide-title">INTRODUCTION</p>
			<p>of behaviours that are required to achieve organisational success. Today almost all the fortune 500 corporations have integrated the concept of competencies in all critical areas of human resources management. The Competency Development Report aids organisations to identify and develop competency related behaviours.</p>
			<p>This report uses Psytech’s Universal (Fine Nine) Competency Framework to predict Samantha’s typical behaviour in each of the model’s competency domains. A competency is defined as the specific set of skills, knowledge and behaviour that is required to complete particular work tasks effectively. Unlike aptitudes or personality traits, which are relatively enduring and stable over time, competencies can be acquired and refined through appropriate mentoring, coaching and training. The report is intended as a tool to facilitate her personal development. It can be used as a starting point to:</p>
			<div class="sub-sentence">Explore possible development needs with her, and produce a development strategy for her.</div>
			<div class="sub-sentence">Consider reasons for any possible discrepancies between her predicted behaviour and her actual performance as assessed by peer ratings, performance appraisals, etc.</div>
			<br>
			<p class="guide-title">SUPPLEMENTARY REPORTS</p>
			<p>The information gained from this report can be used in conjunction with other supplementary reports. The supplementary reports available for the Competency Focused Personality Assessment are:</p>
			<table class="col">

							<img class="col-div-scroll" src="images/col-div-scroll.png" style="width: 2px; height: 24px;">
					</td>
					<td class="col-2">
						The Extended Report is the most comprehensive of the 15FQ+ expert reports. The main narrative is broken down into three major behavioural clusters: Interpersonal Style, Thinking Style and Coping Style. Further information is provided on behavioural styles and likely business outcomes such as Team Roles, Leadership Styles, Subordinate Styles, Influencing Styles and Career Themes. This is followed by a brief summary of potential strengths and development areas. The report also provides an appendix of profile charts which covers the primary and secondary factors of the test as well as criterion derived scales and response style scales.

			<p class="guide-title">CONTEXT</p>
			<p>The profile arises from a personality questionnaire. It must be interpreted in the context of other elevant factors such as experience, training, and wider skills. For example, Samantha’s past performance can be assessed through a critical review of references, her work history and previous qualifications, and via a structured interview. Her level of job specific knowledge can be assessed via the use of work sample tests and simulations, and behavioural interviews. Finally, her skills can be assessed in greater detail through behavioural observation, role-plays and assessment centre exercises.</p>
			<p>The profile should also be considered in light of the organisation’s own competency framework and culture. While the report uses Psytech’s Universal Competency Framework, users are encouraged to identify and focus on the most relevant competencies to the job of interest.</p>

				<p>CF°I&copy; was developed to directly measure levels of fit to optimise people decisions. Unlike traditional personality and work scales, CF°I&copy; explicitly assesses an individual’s fit aptitude and likely performance with an organisation, team, project or assignment. Results from CF°I&copy; can therefore be used to make global and specific decisions about an individual’s capability, suitability and productivity. It is appropriate for all levels of employee from intern to director, and is effective for use throughout an employee's career life-span, particularly as one advances in seniority or work complexity.<br><br>
				One unique feature of CF°I&copy; is the measurement of an individual’s fit with leadership styles. This provides an additional layer of insight into how effective or integrated a candidate is likely to be if assigned to a team, function or task managed by a specific type of leader. In addition to assessing fit across environments, projects and work schemes, CF°I&copy; may be applied to identify sources of existing misfit evidenced by employment issues such as disengagement, demotivation, underproductivity, conflict, distrust, non-commitment, deviant work behaviours and voluntary turnover. In so doing, CF°I&copy; is a valuable resource that should be in the arsenal of every HR Practitioner, Recruiter, Manager, Trainer, Head-Hunter, Consultant, OD &amp; Change Expert, and Talent Specialist.</p>
